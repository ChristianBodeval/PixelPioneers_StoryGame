The one who ran in fear… I wonder why you are here?","\n","^Brokkr: Don’t talk like I’m some coward!","\n","^Brokkr: I need to find the artifacts so you can deliver them to the gods.","\n","^Scryer: Ohuhu, struck a nerve, did I? So we’re just going to pretend you didn’t run?","\n","^Scryer: Alright, as you wish, since at least you are here now.","\n","^Brokkr: Can you even contact the gods, much less deliver the artifacts if I find them?","\n","^Scryer: Oh my, doubting me now, I see, tsk tsk.","\n","^Scryer: The gods won’t talk to me as of now, they will however listen once they realize I have the artifacts - which you’re going to be a dear and get, hm?","\n","^Brokkr: And that’s not… Dangerous?","\n","^Scryer: Bah! Of course it’s dangerous! You’re dealing with gods and monsters!…","\n","^Brokkr: ...","\n","^Brokkr: A man ran past with a big glowing bag and he mumbled about hiding something away.","\n","^Scryer: Hm, interesting… Very interesting actually - why would there be… Ah, of course, it all makes sense!","\n","^Scryer: That little PEST!… Who you saw was… Loki. The big bad guy in all of this.","\n","^Brokkr: Loki!? H-how am I supposed to get the artifacts from… Loki?","\n","^Scryer: Well, I don’t suppose he’ll just hand them over to you if you ask nicely and with pleading puppy eyes - so, fight it shall be.","\n","^Brokkr: I-I don’t think I can do that, I’m just a-","\n","^Scryer: -Blacksmith’s son! I Heard all of this before. There was a reason you came here…","\n","^Brokkr: My father, he’s deadly sick. He needs an elixir from the other town to stay mostly healthy, but the courier can’t deliver when the gods are fighting.","\n","^Scryer: Hm, well, as long as you do as i say, even if it is for such a predictable reason. Our goals align, off you go!","\n","^Brokkr: W-wait. How am I supposed to fight a god!?","\n","^Scryer: Technically, a giant… - but, ah, that does not matter! You have Zeus’ sword and know moderately how to use it!","\n","^Scryer: Also, blacksmith’s son, who can presumably forge, what could you possibly do to enhance your chances?","\n","^Brokkr: How on Midgard am I supposed to upgrade a magical weapon!?","\n","^Scryer: Trying seems like a start.","\n","^Brokkr: You are infuriating! Why do you even want to stop the gods?","\n","^Scryer: ...The gods being angry is not exactly good for business, the traveling scryer can’t go anywhere in these conditions.","\n","^Brokkr: So it’s all about business is it? I should have known…","\n","^Brokkr: Right. I’ll try to do something with the weapon on the maintenance anvil over there.","\n","^Brokkr: <i>Hopefully, I can use it to defend myself.</i>","\n","^Scryer: Get to it then!","\n","^Brokkr: I’m going.
